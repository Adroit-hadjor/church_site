        <h2>How to Practice</h2>
        <p>
            This simple app provides a starting position for a chessboard. Use it to practice
            various strategies by moving pieces around. Focus on one strategy at a time:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Openings</strong> – Practice common openings like the Ruy Lopez or Sicilian Defense.</li>
            <li><strong>Tactics</strong> – Work on forks, pins, skewers and discovered attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Endgames</strong> – Practice king and pawn endings, rook endings and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Middlegame Plans</strong> – Learn typical plans based on pawn structures and piece activity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Play out positions repeatedly. Analyze your games afterwards to identify mistakes and improvements.
            Consistent deliberate practice helps you improve quickly.
